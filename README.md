Android and Microsoft Phone apps using the Microsoft Band Accelerometer

I was using visual studio 2015 to develop Microsoft windows phone applications. The app allows you to edit the properties of a
sound wave (square, sine, triangle) by changing its frequency, attack, decay etc... This was achieved by using the accelerometer
which is in the Microsoft band and by moving the band it alters the wave properties. 
Other Applications included a fully functional Piano with 3 octaves. The user was able to play the piano with one hand while using
the Microsofts Band Acelerometer to change octaves by raising or lowering their hand.
Another Application included a 16 button soundboards with sounds such as Drums, bass, strings and lead which the user was able to4
switch by using a drop down menu.
